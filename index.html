        <!-- Add here a quick intro about yourself-->
        <p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ </br>Welcome to my site! I am Matilde, I am a software engineer.</p>
        <p>I am a Software Engineer and an avid learner. I received a PhD in Philosophy from the University of Birmingham in 2019. My research focussed on the Epistemic Rationality of Emotions and was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. During my final year of PhD I realised that philosophy and software are not as different as they seem. I discovered a passion for programming and I joined The Economist (Birmingham, UK) as a Software Engineer. I also started to collaborate with SikhNet in 2021, working mainly on back-end development. I love cloud infrastructure, programming and the buzz of the Birmingham tech community. I am a passionate about teaching and volunteered as a lead instructor for CodeFirst: Girls, a social enterprise that pledged to teach women to code to challenge the gender imbalance in the tech industry. I am also a School of Code mentor and I collaborate with the University of Birmingham as a career mentor.</p>
